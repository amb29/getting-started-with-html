  <p><h1>BASICS OF THE WEB</h1></p>
There are at least five important subjetcs to be studied as basic elements on this topic:<em> the web itself, the code language HTML, the repository URL,<br>
the protocol HTTP and proper web aplications</em>. First of all the web - or world wide web. 
<br>
<br>
<b>The World Wide Web</b>
<br>
<br>
The  <em>World Wide Web</em> is a collection of HTML documents, which stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. The documents are all linked to one ano-
<br>
ther throught <em>Hyper Links</em>. All kinds of file can exist on the web, music, video, images - HTML documents can refer to anything.
<br>
There are four main actors in the web: <em>users, computers + browsers, the internet itself and servers.</em> The user put up an internet adress on his browser<br>
and it makes a request via the internet to the servers, using the HTTP protocol. The servers respond with files displaced by the browser. Servers are com-
<br>
puters which host files, and the HTTP is the main protocol used on internet communications. Web documents, as said before, are written in a language
<br>
called HTML, the next topic. 
<br>
<br>
<b>HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language</b>
<br>
<br>
HTML or <em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em> is the language used to write documents placed on the web. It is made of four components: <em>text content</em>, or 
<br>the text that can be seen; <em>Markup</em>, or what the text looks like; <em>References</em> to other documents; and <em>Links</em> to other pages. Text content is plain text, while 
<br>
markup is used to mark texts up.
<br>
<br>
<b>HTML Markup</b>
<br>
<br>
Texts are marked up using tags. Usually an <em>element</em> is made of an openinge tab, a closing tab and contents, for example:
<br>
<p>Ex: < >contents< > ----- This is called an <em> element</em> </p> 

In an element the contents inside the opening and closing tags are marked up with the effects of that tag. There are several kinds of tags, which one with
<br>its own markup effect on text, like the b (bold) tag, em (emphasis - <em> italics</em>), Anchor tags (a), used to make links, image tags(img), among others. There are
<br>
also tags with attributes (tag attr = "value")", which have values. It is important to say that image tags are void tags, that don´t need a closing tab. 
<br>
<br>
<B>Whitespace</B>
<br>
<br>
All that is put in HTML turn in a single space. If a user writes a text in multiple lines, it appears in a single line, in whitespace. It is necessary to force multi-
<br>
ple lines using tags. The <em>break tag (br)</em> is the first way. It is a void tag to be used after any line the users wants a break. The other way is with <em>paragrarh tag
  <br>
  (p)</em>, which is not a void tag. The main difference between those two tags is that <em>break</em> is an <em>inline tag</em>, while <em>p</em> is a <em> block</em> one.
<br>
<br>
<b>Inline and Block elements</b>  
  <br>
  <br>Block and inline tags have different behaviour. Inline elements fit within a line, somentimes ending it, like break tag. Block tags make and an invisible box
  <br> around the text, that can have height and width. Examples of inline elements are: a, span, br, image strong. Some examples of block elements: div, p, form.
  <br>
  <br>

  <b>Container elements</b>
  <br>
  <br>
  Containers are elements that contain stuff inside them. There are two container tags: <em>span</em> and <em>div</em>. Span is an inline element, while div is a block one. They both
  <br>
  can use CSS, which is a language to give styles to documents. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Computers and stupidity</b>
  <br>
  <br>
  It is good to remember that computers are stupid, and that is not a bad thing to say. They are stupid because they only interpret instructions literaly.
